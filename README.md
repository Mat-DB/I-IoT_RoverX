## Directory STM

The code base for the master and slave STM32.

In the main.h we can define if we want to build code for the slave or master.

We can also enable or disable debug messages to terminal to save on clock cycles and therefore power.


## Direcotory BLE

The code for the two BLE modules.

As the filenames say, on for the master and one for the slave BLE module.
